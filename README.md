# SillyTavern-Tokenizers

Tokenizer files to use with SillyTavern.

They will be automatically downloaded the first time you use the tokenizer from the app.

If you don't want to use internet downloads, download the JSON files and put them in the `_cache` subdirectory of your data root, `/data/_cache` by default. Create the `_cache` directory if you can't find it. After that, restart the SillyTavern server to re-initialize tokenizers.
